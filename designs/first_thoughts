CLI_CHAT Think Tank
	I want this to be an application that allows users to have conversations with other users via a middle man server.
Each user will have a specific id number which the server will track and handle.  Each user will also have a series of
conversations which will pass through the server but will not permanently reside there.

	Users will be able to:
		1) Send and recieve messages
		2) Manage conversations
		3) Add conversations with new users via tags

	The server will:
		1) Act as a middle man, storing conversation data only until the target user connects
		2) Have a list of all users by their auto generated tags
		3) Organize incoming traffic into lists to be delivered to destination users when they connect

	All server client communication will be done via JSON strings, the list of messages to be delivered to users will be
organized via a sql database.
